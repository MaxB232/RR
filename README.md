# the Renaissance Repository (RR)
The codes in this consolidated repository are associated with two forthcoming texts,<BR>
<a href="http://robotics.ucsd.edu/RR.pdf">Renaissance Robotics</a> and
<a href="http://robotics.ucsd.edu/RR.pdf">Numerical Renaissance</a>,
by Thomas Bewley.<BR>  The former, which covers dynamics, signals & systems, circuits, and classical control theory, is intended to be accessible by advanced undergraduates;
the first several chapters of it, which discuss how microcontrollers,
electronics boards, and motors work, are likely also accessible by advanced high school students. The latter, which covers linear algebra, spectral methods, numerical simulation of ODEs & PDEs, derivative-based & derivative-free optimization, and state-space control & estimation theory, and which builds directly on the former, is designed primarily for students in graduate school or beyond. Drafts of these two texts are maintained at the above two links; to expore further what they are about, please read their frontmatter.<BR>

The various pedagogical codes in the Renaissance Repository (all prefixed by RR_, and mostly written in Matlab/Octave though there are also a few codes in Fortran and C) are organized in this repo by the individual chapters of these two texts.
If you are interested in studying these texts and using their associated codes,
please <B>clone</B> (don't fork) this reposistory (available at <a href="https://github.com/tbewley/RR.git">https://github.com/tbewley/RR.git</a>) to your computer(s) using, for example, <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">GitHub Desktop</a>, and fetch updates from its main branch relatively often,
as I currently update this repository multiple times a week.<BR><BR>
To set your Matlab/Octave path in a way that will streamline your use of these codes,
please call <a href="https://github.com/tbewley/RR/blob/main/RR_path_init.m">RR_path_init.m</a> from your startup.m file, and discussed in sections A.4-A.5 of <a href="http://robotics.ucsd.edu/RR.pdf">Renaissance Robotics</a>.<BR><BR>
To suggest a bug fix, please submit a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests">pull request</a>.
