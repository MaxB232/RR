# the Renaissance Repository (RR)
The codes in this consolidated repository are associated with two forthcoming texts,<BR>
<a href="http://robotics.ucsd.edu/RR.pdf">Renaissance Robotics</a> (also abbreviated RR) and
<a href="http://robotics.ucsd.edu/RR.pdf">Numerical Renaissance</a> (NR),<BR>
by Thomas Bewley.  The RR text is intended to be accessible by advanced undergraduates, but the first several chapters of it are likely also accessible by advanced high school students; the NR text, which builds directly on the RR text,
is designed primarily for students in graduate school or beyond. Drafts of these texts are maintained at the above two links; to see what they are about, please read their frontmatter.<BR>

The various pedagogical codes in the Renaissance Repository (all prefixed by RR_, and mostly written in Matlab/Octave though there are also a few codes in Fortran and C) are organized in this repo by the individual chapters of these two (RR and NR) texts.
If you are interested in using these texts and their associated codes, please <B>clone</B> (don't fork) <a href="https://github.com/tbewley/RR">this repository</a> to your computer using, for example, <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">GitHub Desktop</a>, and fetch updates from its main branch relatively often,
as I currently update this repository multiple times a week.<BR><BR>
To set your Matlab/Octave path in a way that will streamline your use of these codes,
please call <a href="https://github.com/tbewley/RR/blob/main/RR_path_init.m">RR_path_init.m</a> from your startup.m file, and discussed in sections A.4-A.5 of <a href="http://robotics.ucsd.edu/RR.pdf">Renaissance Robotics</a>.<BR><BR>
To suggest a bug fix, please submit a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests">pull request</a>.
