# the Renaissance Repository - one repo to rule them all
<BR>The codes in this repository are associated with the forthcoming texts<BR>
<a href="http://robotics.ucsd.edu/RR.pdf">Renaissance Robotics</a> (RR), and
<a href="http://robotics.ucsd.edu/RR.pdf">Numerical Renaissance</a> (NR),
by Thomas Bewley.<BR>
Drafts of these texts are maintained at the above two links.<BR>

The various codes in this repository are broken out by chapters.<BR>
If you are interested in using these two texts and their associated codes, please clone <a href="https://github.com/tbewley/RR">this repository</a><BR>
using, for example, <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">GitHub Desktop</a>, and fetch updates from its main branch relatively often,<BR>
as I currently update this repository multiple times a week.<BR>
To set your Matlab/Octave path in a way that will streamline your testing of these codes,<BR>
please install <a href="https://github.com/tbewley/RR/blob/main/RR_path_init.m">RR_path_init.m</a> as specified in its comments, and discussed further in sections A.4-A.5 of <a href="http://robotics.ucsd.edu/RR.pdf">Renaissance Robotics</a>.<BR>
To suggest a bug fix, please submit a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests">pull request</a>.
