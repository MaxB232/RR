# the Renaissance Repository
The codes in this repository are associated with two forthcoming texts,<BR>
<a href="http://robotics.ucsd.edu/RR.pdf">Renaissance Robotics</a> (RR) and
<a href="http://robotics.ucsd.edu/RR.pdf">Numerical Renaissance</a> (NR),
by Thomas Bewley.<BR>
Drafts of these texts are maintained at the above two links.<BR>

The various codes in this repository are organized by the chapters of these two texts.
If you are interested in using these texts and their associated codes, please <B>clone</B> <a href="https://github.com/tbewley/RR">this repository</a>
using, for example, <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">GitHub Desktop</a>, and fetch updates from its main branch relatively often,
as I currently update this repository multiple times a week.<BR><BR>
