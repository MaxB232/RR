function RR_Dad_Jokes(i_max)
% Modifies a random sequence of integers generated by Matlab's randi command to
% eliminate integers that appear as the n+1=8 most recent integers in the sequence.
% Each integer could correspond to a "joke" in a "dictionary".
% TODO: replace the "jokes" below with jokes that are actually funny.
