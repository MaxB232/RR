Set Up Notes for ME396 Lab I2C 3 Axis Magnetometer Fall 2024
10/30/2024 By Briggs
This lab uses an RPi and the I2C magnetometer HMC5883L to demonstrate using the I2C bus.
Connect the I2C Magnetometer SCL to GPIO3 (header pin 5), SDA to GPIO2 (header pin 3), VCC to 3.3v(header pin 1), and GND to Gnd (header pin 6).

The example program i2c_magnetometer.c will initialize the I2C bus and the magnetometer and then request heading readings once per second.
The heading output is in degrees. Note the indication of North on the PCB.

Exit the program by pressing ^C (ctrl-C).
