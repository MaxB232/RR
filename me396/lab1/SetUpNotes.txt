Set Up Notes for ME396 Lab I2C 3 Axis Magnetometer Fall 2024
10/30/2024 By Briggs

This lab uses an RPi and the I2C magnetometer HMC5883L to demonstrate using the I2C bus.
Connect the I2C Magnetometer SCL to GPIO3 (header pin 5), connect SDA to GPIO2 (header pin 3), 
connect both VIN and 3vo to 3.3v (header pin 1), and connect GND to GND (header pin 6).

To make the code, once you copy this directory of files to your RPi, execute the following commands:
  chmod +x makeme.sh
  ls -alh              # Note that the chmod command above makes the makeme.sh script executable!
  ./compassdemo        # Note that the ./ portion of this command is needed, to make bash look for the executable here.

The example program i2c_magnetometer.c will initialize the I2C bus and the magnetometer
and then request heading readings once per second.
The heading output is in degrees. Note the indication of North on the PCB.

Exit the program by pressing ^C (ctrl-C).
