% First, determine the locations of the nodes of the Signpost (in meters)
P=[]; R=[];  % No Pinned or Roller supports in this case
S=[ 0;       % Columns denote (x,y) locations of each of the s=1 Fixed support
    0];
Q=[ 0 0 0 -2 1;    % (x,y) locations of the n=5 free nodes
    2 3 4  3 3];   % (the second node makes the plot nice)
U=[ 0 0 0  0 0;   % External forces applied to each of the n=5 free nodes (in Newtons)
    0 0 0 -1 0];  
   % The m=4 structural Members of this pin-jointed frame are defined in the columns of CT.
CT=[ 1 0 0 1;  % q_1   Each structural member connects several (Q,P,R,S) nodes of the frame, 
     1 1 0 0;  % q_2   as indicated by the 1's in the corresponding columns at left.
     1 0 1 0;  % q_3   Note: each structural member may connect 3 or more nodal points
     0 1 1 0;  % q_4   (and, thus, each structural member may bear internal bending loads), 
     0 1 0 1;  % q_5   and each node may have 3 or more strucural members attached,

% Now, convert the linear eqns for determining the static equilibrium of the frame into the
% standard A*x=u form.  Note that these equations of static equilbrium are just the following:
%   (a) the sum of forces on each pin = zero,
%   (b) the sum of forces on each structural member = zero, and 
%   (c) the sum of moments on each structural member = zero.
C=CT';  [A,b]=RR_Convert_Frame_to_Ax_eq_b(Q,C,U,P,R,S); 
% Then, solve for the interior forces in the frame, assuming no pretensioning.
